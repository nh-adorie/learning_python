# Check if a Number is Perfect
# In number theory, a perfect number is a positive integer 
# that is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors, 
# that is, the sum of its positive divisors excluding the number itself 
# (also known as its aliquot sum). 
# 
# Equivalently, a perfect number is a number that is half the sum 
# of all of its positive divisors (including itself).

# eg. 6 = 1 + 2 + 3 

num = input('Let me see if your number is a perfect number!')
if num.isdigit():
    check = int(num)
    if check <= 0:
        print('Not perfect')
    else:
        none

    print('Not perfect')
